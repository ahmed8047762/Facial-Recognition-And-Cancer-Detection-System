# Face Recognition and Skin Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project encompasses tasks related to face detection, recognition, and an incremental face recognition system, along with skin cancer detection using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. The implemented solutions demonstrate accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness in their respective tasks.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Face Detection and Preprocessing

Implemented a face detection system using OpenCV’s Haar cascade classifier. Detected faces were preprocessed, including grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization, ensuring consistent input format and size.

### Task 2: Face Recognition Model Training

Trained the face recognition model using preprocessed face images. Employed a machine learning algorithm, possibly a neural network, loaded using joblib. Monitored training progress, including accuracy and loss, over epochs to ensure accurate face recognition.

### Task 3: Incremental Face Recognition System

Implemented an incremental face recognition system, allowing the addition of new employees without retraining the entire model. The system provides a web interface for employee registration and recognition, utilizing Flask for the web framework and integrating the OpenCV-based face recognition model.

### Task 4: Skin Cancer Detection using MLP

Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for classifying skin cancer data into seven different classes. The network architecture included hidden layers, neurons per layer, and specific activation functions. Computed evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix, to assess the model’s performance.

## Conclusion

The project successfully implemented tasks related to face detection, recognition, and an incremental face recognition system. Additionally, skin cancer detection using a multi-layer perceptron model showcased accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness. The solutions presented in this project have practical applications in diverse domains.
